Tried to hard to get reviews to work. Can't seem to do it, really am clueless.

I have added multiple worded searches for movies. 

Ruby Project

* Allows user to search in a box. -Done
* Ability to add reviews to a film show. -Almost
* Option to search through a category, for more directed results. Can be done.
* Search for actors. -Don’t think so.
* Add filter to only search for movies. Done
* Sort movie titles by year / alphabet. Done
* Problem with searching with a space. ( need to replace ‘ ‘ with ‘%’
* Add another index page/option on index page to search through movies /tv series. Using a |movies|tv-series| type thing.
